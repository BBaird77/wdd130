        Kairos is an old world. It has seen millennia pass by since the age where the gods walked amongst us, their creations. I am one of the first, the eternal record keeper. I have chronicled all that has occurred and am now sharing it with the world. I hope that this information will help you to understand the struggles of this world, and perhaps, its outcome can be guided to a better path. I wish you the best of fortune.
        - Daemon Stone
        A world ruled over by gods that forged each and every thing within it, from the smallest plant to the largest mountain. They once walked among us, in the land now known as Ultima Terra, although in that age it held a different name. The gods warred, and as they battled, the very land crumbled beneath their wrath. In the aftermath, most humans left the ruined continent and moved to new lands, each ruled by a sect of gods. The gods agreed to the Codex, a complex rule of laws designed to ensure that this disaster never occurred again.

      <h3>Setting</h3>
      <p>
        The World of Kairos is large and has multiple different continents. Each have different qualities and laws governing them. The continents of Averento, Rak’Tar, Escalia (not pictured), Arcadia (not pictured), and Ultima Terra all have different rules and laws governing them.
        Averento is a continent ruled by science, technology, and study, with the God of Science as the highest order.
        Rak Tar is a continent ruled by magic, with the God of Magic as the highest order.
        Escalia is a continent ruled by balance, with the God of Balance as the highest order.
        Arcadia is the continent of primordials, ruled over by the primordials, the first living creations of the gods. They can best be described as demigods, with the same immortality as the gods, but far less individual power.
        Ultima Terra is a wasteland, ruled by none and wanted by none. It is filled with immense pockets of concentrated magic, which can be hazardous to the health of those who enter there.
